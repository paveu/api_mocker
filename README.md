### Tech

API Mocker uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - free and open-source Python web framework.
* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - webpack is a module bundler this means webpack takes modules with dependencies and emits static assets representing those modules.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.
* [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) - open source asynchronous task queue or job queue which is based on distributed message passing.
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) - Python HTTP library, released under the Apache2 License.
* [django-crispy-forms](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Django application that lets you easily build, customize and reuse forms using your favorite CSS framework, without writing template code and without having to take care of annoying details.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) - real-time error tracking gives you insight into production deployments and information to reproduce and fix crashes.
